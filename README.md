# 🩺 My Health Companion

My Health Companion is a simple health management web application that helps users track medicines and appointments in one place.  
The goal of this project is to understand how a real-world full-stack application is structured and how different components work together.

## 📌 Project Overview

Managing daily medicines and health appointments can be difficult, especially for elderly users or people managing multiple prescriptions.  
This application provides a basic digital companion to organize health-related information in a simple and user-friendly way.

---

## ✨ Features

- User authentication
- Add, view, and manage medicines
- Track doctor appointments
- Clean and responsive user interface
- Backend integration for data storage

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Backend & Database:** Supabase
- **Tooling:** Lovable (initial project scaffold)

---

## 🚀 How the Project Was Built

This project was initially scaffolded using **Lovable** to generate the base application structure.  
After that, I studied the codebase, understood the application flow, and improved the documentation while planning further enhancements.

The focus of this project is **learning application structure, understanding integrations, and iterative improvement** rather than building everything from scratch in the first version.
